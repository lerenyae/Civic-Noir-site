    synopsis: `Baltimore, 2006. A deputy mayor is shot dead at a community rally. Satellite trucks line the curb outside the Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr. Courthouse. The city seals up.

By the following summer, a nineteen-year-old sits in county waiting to begin the fight for his innocence. The lawyer with the balls to defend him collapses on the courthouse steps — briefcase in hand, files inside — leaving behind a son who never wanted the name in the first place.

Shawn Davidson spent the last two years trying to outrun Baltimore. Now he's back holding the file, the firm, and whatever his father was carrying when he went down. The trial doesn't pause. The docket doesn't care. And the State already has a version of events it can live with.

Across town, a demoted detective trades favors with the same dirty hands that built the case — because the only way to protect the people he loves is to play the game that can bury them. And in the margins, a journalist chasing a missing trial witness discovers that some stories don't want exposure.

They want control.`,

His debut novel, Contempt, is set in Baltimore, 2006. A deputy mayor is killed in public. A nineteen-year-old sits in county. And Shawn Davidson, a defense attorney trying to outrun his father's legacy, is forced to take a trial the city needs to control.

Watkins spent two decades in enterprise sales and fifteen years in cybersecurity — work that taught him how institutions speak, how they protect themselves, and what they do to the people inside them.`,
